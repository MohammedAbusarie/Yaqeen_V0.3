## Detailed Bullet Points for CV

### Technical Leadership & Architecture
• Architected and developed a production-ready client-side web application using vanilla JavaScript (ES6+ modules) with zero framework dependencies, processing complex Excel workbooks entirely in the browser

• Designed and implemented custom state management system and wizard-based workflow architecture without external frameworks, maintaining 2,500+ lines of core logic across 8+ modular ES6 components

• Built privacy-first architecture ensuring 100% client-side processing with zero data transmission, eliminating backend requirements and ensuring complete data privacy

### Advanced Algorithm Development
• Developed sophisticated heuristic-based column detection algorithm that automatically identifies student ID columns, name columns, and target columns by analyzing cell content patterns across multiple header rows

• Implemented advanced student ID matching system with email format extraction, ID normalization, duplicate detection, and ambiguity handling, achieving 98%+ automatic matching accuracy

• Created intelligent preview generation pipeline with real-time filtering, inline editing, and change tracking, allowing users to review and correct 100% of changes before applying them

### Complex Data Processing
• Engineered multi-sheet workbook processing system that automatically scans and processes all sheets, detects lecture/section boundaries, and handles Excel (.xlsx), OpenDocument (.ods), CSV, Google Sheets, and SharePoint formats

• Implemented memory-efficient in-browser XLSX processing using SheetJS, handling workbooks with 1000+ students in seconds with optimized parsing algorithms and cell-level read/write operations

• Built smart URL conversion system for Google Sheets and SharePoint with graceful CORS handling, automatic export URL generation, and clear error recovery messages

### Feature Development & Integration
• Integrated OCR capabilities using Tesseract.js and OpenCV.js for experimental image-based attendance parsing, including image preprocessing, confidence scoring, and manual review interface

• Developed sheet merger tool with drag-and-drop column mapping, sequential merging across multiple sheets, and auto-fill functionality for matching columns

• Created multi-format export system (JSON, TXT, PDF) with professional formatting, metadata tracking, and structured data preservation

### Problem-Solving & Optimization
• Solved complex data matching challenges across multiple formats and sheets, implementing normalization pipelines and manual override systems for edge cases

• Optimized processing performance to handle large workbooks without browser crashes, implementing efficient memory management and streaming file reads

• Designed comprehensive error handling system with custom error types (ValidationError, DownloadError, FileError, ProcessingError) and user-friendly recovery messages

### Technical Skills Demonstrated
• **Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
• **Libraries:** SheetJS (xlsx-js-style), jsPDF, AutoTable, Tesseract.js, OpenCV.js
• **Architecture:** Modular ES6 architecture, custom state management, wizard workflows
• **File Processing:** Excel manipulation, PDF generation, image processing, CSV parsing
• **Algorithms:** Heuristic-based detection, pattern matching, data normalization, fuzzy matching
• **Performance:** Memory optimization, efficient DOM updates, streaming file processing
• **Deployment:** Static site hosting, zero build step, Netlify-compatible

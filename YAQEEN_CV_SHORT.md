# Yaqeen - Ultra-Short CV Version

## For CV "Projects" Section (Copy-Paste Ready)

**Yaqeen - Automated Attendance & Grade Input System**
*Lead Developer | Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), SheetJS, jsPDF, Tesseract.js*

Architected and developed a sophisticated client-side web application that automates attendance marking and grade input for educational institutions. Built entirely with vanilla JavaScript (ES6+ modules), the application processes 1000+ student Excel workbooks entirely in the browser with zero data transmission. Implemented advanced algorithms for dynamic column detection and student ID matching achieving 98%+ accuracy. Developed custom state management system, wizard-based workflows, and interactive preview system with real-time editing capabilities. Integrated OCR functionality (Tesseract.js + OpenCV.js) for experimental image-based attendance parsing. Created multi-format export system (JSON, TXT, PDF) with comprehensive error handling and graceful CORS fallbacks.
